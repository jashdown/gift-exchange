Gives a group of people assignments for who they are to give a gift too.

Each person needs to login to see who they have, so as to keep it a secret from everyone else.

Can set exclusions to guarntee that someone will not get assigned a certian person.

Need to run assign.php to give out the assignments.
assign.php does have a known issue where it can not assign everyone when using the exlusions.
